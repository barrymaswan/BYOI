# BYOI

Build Your Own Internet was a project I worked on while studying abroad in London.

It's a web app built, primarily with children in mind, to illustrate how communication over the internet works.

The back end (HumanNetworkServer.jar) was built by Dave Cohen - a lecturer at Royal Holloway University of London. I built the front end.
